# Dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of configuration files.
The aim of this repo is to make swapping computers as easy
as possible, keeping all settings from one system to another.


## Install

Certain dotfiles depend on some things to be installed at seperate places.
The [install.sh](install.sh) script aims to handle all the necessary things.
